## [What is Two Pointers?]()

The **Two Pointers** technique uses two references (indices/pointers) to traverse a data structure, typically moving in a coordinated way to solve problems efficiently in **O(n)** time instead of **O(n²)**.

**Data Structures:** Primarily used with: `ARRAY`, `STRINGS`, `LINKEDLIST`

## [When to Use Two Pointers]()

- Sorted Data or Can Be Sorted
- Need to Compare/Process Elements from Different Positions
- Finding Pairs, Triplets, or Quadruplets
- Merging or comparing two Sequences
- Cycle Detection
